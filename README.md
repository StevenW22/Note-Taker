# Note Taker Express JS APP

## Description

This application was made with Express js and deployed using Heroku. It was tested locally before starting the steps to deploy the final product on Heroku. Notetaker is a simple notetaking application. When the user first enters the initial page, you see a button that says get started. When I click on the button, it takes me to the notes page, where a user can create, read, update and delete notes, following the CRUD method. To run this application locally, navigate to the js file and open it in the integrated terminal. Start by running NPM I and then npm start. I used heroku in the terminal and ran ENV to attain my port 3884. In your browser, type http://localhost:3884/.
